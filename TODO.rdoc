* Bundler automatically sets the LOAD_PATH and takes care of datadir; use it!
* Remove generator, suggesting `bundle gem` instead.
* Start running on 1.9: Gem::Validator uses MiniTest::Unit.

= Someday Maybe

* Automatically bump to next prerelease version on release?
* Re-think focus: probably want to ditch cucumber, since I'm not using it for shoe?
* Document rake task hooks prepare:execute and prepare:release.
