.SH "NAME"
\fBshoe\fR \-\- generate a rubygems project
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBshoe\fR [\-\fBadehtv\fR] [\fIpath\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBshoe\fR command generates a new rubygems project \fIThe Right Way\fR, giving you
stubs that respect the \fBLOAD_PATH\fR and top\-level modules that don't do too
much. \fBShoe\fR's built\-in \fBrake(1)\fR tasks then derive their configuration from your \fBgemspec\fR and its surrounding environment, keeping your configuration DRY.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBshoe\fR's default mode of operation is to generate a basic library, its \fBRakefile\fR, and some \fBTest::Unit\fR tests in the current directory. (You may pass
a different \fIpath\fR on the command line, if you like.)
.
.P
To generate additional files, use the following options:
.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-[no\-]application\fR
Generate a command\-line application. This adds a simple executable script in
the \fBbin\fR directory and an \fBApplication\fR class that uses the \fBoptparse\fR
library to handle command\-line options.
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-[no\-]data\fR
Generate a data directory. This adds a \fBdata\fR directory (perfect for HTML
templates and other static assets) and provides a \fBdatadir\fR method in your
top\-level module to access it.
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-[no\-]extension\fR
Generate a C extension. This adds an \fBext\fR directory with an \fBextconf.rb\fR and
a bare\-bones \fBextension.c\fR defining a module named \fBExtension\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-[no\-]test\-unit\fR
Generate Test::Unit tests. This adds a \fBtest\fR directory with a \fBhelper.rb\fR
and a single passing test.
.
.P
\fBshoe\fR also responds to the following standard options:
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message and exit.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR[=all]
Print \fBshoe\fR's version number and exit. If \fB=all\fR is given, also print
version numbers of \fBshoe\fR's dependencies. (This is standard \fBoptparse\fR behavior
that deserves more attention!)
.
.SH "AUTHOR"
\fBshoe\fR is the fanatical side project of Matthew Todd, who would love to discuss
it with you. He can be reached on email at \fImatthew.todd@gmail.com\fR or as \fI@matthewtodd\fR on Twitter.
.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBshoe\fR is heavily inspired by \fBhoe\fR, \fBjeweler\fR, and \fBnewgem\fR and heavily influenced by
the conversations around \fBrip\fR, \fBbundler\fR, and the \fBRuby Packaging Standard\fR.
