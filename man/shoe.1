.SH "NAME"
\fBshoe\fR \-\- generate a RubyGems project
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBshoe\fR [\-\fBadehtv\fR] [\fIpath\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBshoe\fR command generates a new RubyGems project. Big deal, right? As
compared with other tools, \fBshoe\fR gently guides you toward hygenic packaging
standards and provides you with a sweet library of on\-demand \fBrake(1)\fR tasks
built around your (authoritative) gemspec.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBshoe\fR's default mode of operation is to generate a basic library, its \fBRakefile\fR, and some \fBTest::Unit\fR tests in the current directory. (You may pass
a different \fIpath\fR on the command line, if you like.)
.
.P
To generate additional files, use the following options:
.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-[no\-]application\fR
Generate a command\-line application. Create a simple executable script in
the \fBbin\fR directory and an \fBApplication\fR class that uses \fBoptparse\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-[no\-]data\fR
Generate a data directory. Create a \fBdata\fR directory (perfect for HTML
templates and other static assets) and a \fBdatadir\fR method in your top\-level
module to access it.
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-[no\-]extension\fR
Generate a C extension. Create an \fBext\fR directory with an \fBextconf.rb\fR and
a bare\-bones \fBextension.c\fR defining a module named \fBExtension\fR.
.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-[no\-]test\-unit\fR
Generate Test::Unit tests. Create a \fBtest\fR directory with a \fBhelper.rb\fR
and a single passing test.
.
.P
\fBshoe\fR also responds to the following standard options:
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message and exit.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR[=all]
Print \fBshoe\fR's version number and exit. If \fB=all\fR is given, also print
version numbers of \fBshoe\fR's dependencies. (This is standard \fBoptparse\fR behavior
that deserves more attention!)
